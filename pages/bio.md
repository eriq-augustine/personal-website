### Computer Science

I started my Computer Science career at [California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/), where I earned my BS and MS in Computer Science in 2013.
My Master's research was on micro-text classification and was done under [Dr. Alexander Dekhtyar](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/).
Afterwards, I worked as a software developer on Netflix's cloud reliability team, where I implemented my thesis, [SPOONS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2187980.2187983), on Spanish tweets to support the South American release of Netflix.
Next, I worked as a software developer on the Extensions Engine Team on the Google Chromium/Chrome web browser.
There I designed and implemented the [Native Messaging API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/nativeMessaging/).
After my time at Google, I became a senior software developer at [Gaine Solutions](https://gaine.com/), where I worked on master data management and production-scale entity resolution systems.
Finally, I decided to return to academia to pursue a Ph.D. in machine learning.
I entered the graduate program at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/),
where I joined the [LINQS Lab](https://linqs.org) under [Dr. Lise Getoor](https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu).
In Winter of 2023, I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from UCSC and started working as a postdoctoral researcher under Dr. Getoor.

### Teaching

Teaching has always held a special place to me.
I have been tutoring various subjects since middle school,
and have managed over twenty clients while still in high school.
When I arrived at Cal Poly, I became a tutor in the Computer Science Department's Tutoring Center, which I eventually managed.
While at Cal Poly, I graded and TA'd for various courses which culminated in becoming a graduate student instructor.
After I graduated Cal Poly, I would periodically come back to lecture for various courses.
While pursuing my Ph.D. at UCSC I have also had the opportunity to revamp a course, co-create a course, and supervise several students at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels.

### Personal

My favorite things are programming, traveling, and going on long walks.
As programming is my favorite hobby, I love to work on different side projects,
many of which you can see on my [my Github](https://github.com/eriq-augustine/).
Aside from programming, I love to travel and take long walks (hopefully together).
I am also very interested in renewable sources of electricity.
I have built my own solar collection and storage array using only reclaimed and salvaged parts.
Someday, I hope to have the opportunity to build my own hydro generator.
