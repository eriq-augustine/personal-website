My name is Eriq Augustine, and I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science (Machine Learning)
working in the [LINQS Lab](https://linqs.org) under [Dr. Lise Getoor](https://getoor.linqs.org/) at UC Santa Cruz.
I work at the intersection of relational information (e.g., logic) and machine learning.

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
After that, I started teaching Computer Science classes at Cal Poly.
I also started working as a senior software developer at a master data management company in San Luis Obispo.
(Full time software developer and lecturer at night.)
After paying off loans, it was time to start the next phase of my academic career and start my PhD.
I received my PhD in Computer Science in the winter of 2023.

I believe that developing software is the ultimate supporting field.
It is the job of the software developer to create tools to help other fields accomplish their tasks, not to accomplish the task themselves.
