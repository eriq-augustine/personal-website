My name is Eriq Augustine, and I am currently working on my Ph.D. in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at UC Santa Cruz.
I am a member of the [LINQS Lab](https://linqs.org) under [Dr. Lise Getoor](https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu).
I work at the intersection of relational information (e.g., logic) and machine learning.

I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
After that, I started teaching Computer Science classes at Cal Poly.
I also started working as a senior software developer at a master data management company in San Luis Obispo.
(Full time software developer and lecturer at night.)
After paying off loans, it was time to start the next phase of my academic career and start my PhD.

I believe that developing software is the ultimate supporting field.
It is the job of the software developer to create tools to help other fields accomplish their tasks, not to accomplish the task themselves.
